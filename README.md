In order to access some api in our application, the user must be authenticated before using our application. The user will get the token back as jwt when using different paths in the application such as buying a product. The system will check if Did the user send the token as well? If sent, it will be able to use that path by verifying the token via passport by using passport-jwt Strategy for verification.
