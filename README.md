## API authentication mechanisms before starting playing around with the application
Use authentication mechanisms is JWT because JWT is use easy and easy understand to develop in my project and JWT is be safe , JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties because they can be signed 
## API authentication mechanisms
In order to access some api in our application, the user must be authenticated before using our application. The user will get the token back as jwt when using different paths in the application such as buying a product. The system will check if Did the user send the token as well? If sent, it will be able to use that path by verifying the token via passport by using passport-jwt Strategy for verification.
There is a privatekey located in the config folder, used as a cryptographic secretkey to receive tokens and verify tokens.
## You have to explain why his or her application is useful, who will be the potential users?
For people who like to read books It must be important, so my application has come to meet people who like to read books and want to collect books that it is not e-book or find books that they want to read . My application will help buyers to find the books they want and can receive the goods quickly.
